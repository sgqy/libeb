<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>When you look up a word in a CD-ROM book using EB Library application,
you might wish the application stops displaying book's text at the point
where explanation of the word ends. 
Howerver, EB Library cannot ensure it, since CD-ROM book has no marker in
its text which indicates end of paragraph.

<p>Fortunately, many CD-ROM books have a <dfn>text stop code</dfn> which could
be used for substitute for end of paragraph. 
EB Library guesses text stop code automatically by default, but sometimes
takes a false code. 
In that case, you have to tell EB Library a correct stop code using
<dfn>Appendix</dfn>.

<p>The <code>ebstopcode</code> command is a utility to analyze text stop code
in a CD-ROM book.

<p>This is edition 4.0, for EB Library version 4.0.
