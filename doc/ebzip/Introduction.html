<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p><code>ebzip</code> is a command to compress/uncompress CD-ROM books for
EB Library applications. 
EB Library applications can access compressed CD-ROM books without
any functional restriction. 
(But, their access speed to compressed books may be slower than that
to original books.) 
Since the compression data format is independent of CPU type,
operating system, and file system, files compressed by <code>ebzip</code>
can be interchanged. 
The <code>ebzip</code> command is distributed with EB Library.

<p><code>ebzip</code> is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
but <em>without any warranty</em>; without even the implied warranty of

GNU General Public License for more details.

<p>In addition, you must follow the licenses of your CD-ROM books. 
Though <code>ebzip</code> is free software, your books may not be free. 
If the publishers of your CD-ROM don't permit to copy the book onto a
hard disk (nor other strage devices), please give up compress the book.

<p>This is edition 4.0beta3, for EB Library version 4.0beta3.
