<h3>Compress Compressed Book</h3>

<p>Also S-EBXA and EPWING define compression formats, and some CD-ROM
books of S-EBXA and EPWING are compressed with the formats. 
However, their compression formats are different from that of ebzip.

<p><code>ebzip</code> (<code>ebunzip</code>) can also uncompress CD-ROM book
compressed with the EPWING or S-EBXA compression fomrat, but it cannot
compress book with the format.

<p>If you command <code>ebzip</code> to compress a CD-ROM book which has been
compressed with a compression format, <code>ebzip</code> automatically
uncompresses the book and compresses it with the ebzip compression.

<p>Compression ratio of the ebzip compression format is generally better
than those of EPWING and S-EBXA formats.
