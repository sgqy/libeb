Introduction
************

   When you look up a word in a CD-ROM book using EB Library
application, you might wish the application stops displaying book's
text at the point where explanation of the word ends.  Howerver, EB
Library cannot ensure it, since CD-ROM book has no marker in its text
which indicates end of paragraph.

   Fortunately, many CD-ROM books have a "text stop code" which could
be used for substitute for end of paragraph.  EB Library guesses text
stop code automatically by default, but sometimes takes a false code.
In that case, you have to tell EB Library a correct stop code using
"Appendix".

   The `ebstopcode' command is a utility to analyze text stop code in a
CD-ROM book.

   This is edition 4.0beta3, for EB Library version 4.0beta3.

Invoke `ebstopcode'
*******************

   Its usual way to invoke `ebstopcode' is as follows:

     % ebstopcode BOOK-PATH SUBBOOK

BOOK-PATH points to the top directory of a CD-ROM book where the file
`catalog' or `catalogs' resides.  It may be a remote access identifer
(`ebnet://...').  If BOOK-PATH is omitted, the current working
directory is assumed.

SUBBOOK is a directory name of the target subbook.  Use the `ebinfo'
command to see what subbooks your CD-ROM has:

     % ebinfo /cdrom
     disc type: EB/EBG/EBXA/EBXA-C/S-EBXA
     character code: JIS X 0208
     the number of subbooks: 2
     subbook 1:
       title: New English Japanese Dictionary (4th edition)
       directory: english
       search methods: word endword keyword menu
       font sizes: 16 24 30 48
       narrow font characters: 0xa121 -- 0xa24e
       wide font characters: 0xa321 -- 0xa27e
     subbook 2:
       title: CD-ROM French Japanese Dictionary (3rd edition)
       directory: french
       search methods: word endword keyword menu
       font sizes: 16 24 30 48
       narrow font characters:
       wide font characters: 0xa321 -- 0xa27e

(*Note Invoke `ebinfo': (ebinfo)Invoke ebinfo, for more details about
the `ebinfo' command).
In this example, there are two subbooks in the book, and their
directory names are `english' and `french'.

   Type the follwing to analyze text stop code of the `english' subbook:

     % ebstopcode /cdrom english

`ebstopcode' outputs text and candidates for stop code of the subbook,
like this:

     === stop-code?: 0x1f09 0x0001 ===
     
     === stop-code?: 0x1f41 0x0100 ===
     A
     
     === stop-code?: 0x1f09 0x0001 ===
     n 1: the blood group whose red cells carry the A antigen.
     
     === stop-code?: 0x1f09 0x0001 ===
     2: a metric unit of length equal to one ten billionth of a meter.
     
     === stop-code?: 0x1f09 0x0001 ===
     3: the basic unit of electric current adopted under the System
     International d'Unites.
     
     === stop-code?: 0x1f09 0x0001 ===
     
     === stop-code?: 0x1f41 0x0100 ===
     (snip)

   Each `stop-code?:' line shows a candidate for stop code.  Specifying
it as text stop code, EB Library stops displaying text at the point.

   The appropriate stop code of the `english' subbook is "0x1f41
0x0100".  Test the stop code using `--no-candidate' and `--code'
options:

     % ebstopcode --no-candidate --code "0x1f41 0x0100" /cdrom english
     A
     n 1: the blood group whose red cells carry the A antigen.
     2: a metric unit of length equal to one ten billionth of a meter.
     3: the basic unit of electric current adopted under the System
     International d'Unites.

Summary of `ebstopcode' Options
*******************************

   The `ebstopcode' command supports both traditional single-letter
options and mnemonic long option names.  Long option names are
indicated with `--' instead of `-'.  Abbreviations for option names are
allowed as long as they are unique.

`-c CODE'
`--code CODE'
     Specify CODE as text stop code (e.g. "0x1f09 0x0001").
     `ebstopcode' displays text until CODE is appeared.

`-h'
`--help'
     Output help message to standard out, then exit.

`-l LENGTH'
`--text-length LENGTH'
     Outputs text data LENGTH bytes maximum.  If LENGTH is set to 0,
     `ebstopcode' outputs the whole text.  By default, the length is
     set to 2048.

`-n'
`--no-candidates'
     Suppress stop code candidates on output.

`-p PAGE:OFFSET'
`--text-position PAGE:OFFSET'
     Start outputting text data at this position.  PAGE must be a
     hexadecimal integer greater than 0, and OFFSET must be a
     hexadecimal integer between 0 and 0x7FF.  If the option is not
     specified, `ebstopcode' starts outputting at the beginning of text
     data.

`-v'
`--version'
     Output version number to standard out, then exit.

   `--code' (`-c') and `--length' (`-l') options override each other.
