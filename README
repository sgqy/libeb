		 C Library for accessing CD-ROM books


EB Library is a C library for accessing CD-ROM books.  It can be built
on UNIX derived systems.  EB Library supports to access CD-ROM books of
EB, EBG, EBXA, EBXA-C, S-EBXA and EPWING formats.  CD-ROM books of those
formats are popular in Japan.  Since CD-ROM books themseves are stands
on the ISO 9660 format, you can mount the discs by the same way as other
ISO 9660 discs.

EB Library also provides some utility commands:

	ebappendix	format appendix files for a CD-ROM book.
	ebfont		get font data of local defined characters in
			a CD-ROM book.
	ebinfo		list information about a CD-ROM book.
	ebrefile	refile a catalog file in a CD-ROM book.
	ebstopchk	utility to analyze text data in a CD-ROM book for
			stop code.
	ebunzip		uncompress a CD-ROM book.
	ebzip		compress a CD-ROM book.
	ebzipinfo	output information about a compressed CD-ROM
			book.


Beginning with version 4.0, EB Library supports remote book access.
You can specify a CD-ROM book on a remote host with remote access
identifer.  The format of the identifer is:

	ebnet://<host>:<port>/<book-name>	  (CD-ROM book)
	ebnet://<host>:<port>/<book-name>.app	  (appendix package)

<host> is a host name or an IP address of the remote host.  Note that
an IPv6 address must be enclosed in `[' and `]'.  <port> is a port
number that the peer listens on.  You can omit the `:<port>' part if
the host listens on the default port, 22010.

For example:
	ebnet://eb.example.com/dict
	ebnet://eb.example.com:22010/dict.app
	ebnet://192.168.1.1/dict.app
	ebnet://192.168.1.1:22010/dict
	ebnet://[fe80::290:27ff:fe3]/dict.app
	ebnet://[fe80::290:27ff:fe3]:22010/dict

To use the remote access, you have to install EBNETD on <host>,
which is remote access server software for EB Library.
